  # The stable build is the newest release, pre-releases included, built from
  # its source tarball. A tarball carries no git metadata, so the build names
  # its release tag as its commit; paisans refuses a tag that is not its own
  # version. `brew install --HEAD paisans-cli` builds develop, which names its
  # commit from git.
